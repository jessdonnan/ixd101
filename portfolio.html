<section id="portfolio"><h2 style="color: #000000;">Nine Iterations</h2>


	<p>For our Nine Iterations project, we were placed into groups and tasked with collecting one hundred examples of one of the follow categories: point, line or plane. Our group chose point, and we chose to focus our research on food.
    </p>
    <p>I decided to focus my project on fruit, specifically three kinds: kiwi, lemon and grapefruit. I chose these three because they have three prominent colours and distinctive, round shapes. I wanted the images to tell a story in terms of the number of fruit there were in each picture.

           <p>For our third project, we had to take the influence of one of our favourite songs, and present it in a way that was appropriately relevant to the artist/lyrics. The song I chose for this project was Running in the Night by FM-84. The song and band has a lot of 80's influence, so I wanted to incorporate that into the project. I also wanted to take into consideration the colours of the album cover, and how it contains typical elements of synth-wave and retro-wave.</p>
